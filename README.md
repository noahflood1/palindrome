I had a dream last night that someone asked me how to check some strings for different conditions in Python and in the dream, I couldn't remember how. It reminded me of this coding problem and made me want to re-approach it from scratch without outside help.
I decided to turn it into an educational resource of sorts, since I quite like this coding problem.

I'm sure this has been done a million times before and in much better, more elegant ways,
but I think there is still value in it nonetheless.

# Hello, code learner!

Before reading my solution (in 'palindrome.py'), try solving this problem yourself.

A palindrome is a string of characters that reads the same forwards as it does backwards.

Given a string, how would you determine if that string is a palindrome or not?

## Challenge:
1) Write down some words of lengths 0, 1, 2, and 3, and manually check whether or not they are palindromes.
2) Write some pseudocode on paper to perform a palindrome check.
	Pseudocode means writing down in plain English what you want your algorithm to do, step by step.
3) Check your code for errors. Step through it with some different words as input.
4) Implement your solution in Python!
	Just type your solution in 'my_solution.py'
5) Run your solution with 'runner.py' See if you got any errors. No errors? Great work! If there were errors, try fixing them!
6) Try improving your code. Can you do the same thing in less lines? Is there a more elegant solution?

## To get started:

1. Clone the repo:
   'git clone [repo URL]'

2. Navigate into the directory:
	'cd palindrome/'

3. Make sure you have python installed and working by running:
   'python runner.py'

4. Start typing your solution to the problem in 'my_solution.py.' To test it, just run 'python runner.py' in the commandline!

5. To run my solution, simply comment-out the line:
   'from my_solution import is_palindrome' 
   and un-comment the line
   '# from palindrome import is_palindrome'
	in 'runner.py'

## Good luck!!
